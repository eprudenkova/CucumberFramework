Class 3

Hooks vs Background
Hooks are implemented for all the features across your project and they are based on annotations @Before and @After
Background is implemented for the specific scenario.
It is used to define one step or multiple steps which are common to all the tests inside your feature file.


    Data Driven Test in Cucumber can be performed in 2 ways
    1. Scenario Outline with examples
    2. Datatable

    Scenario vs Scenario Outline:
    Scenario will run the steps only once and finish the execution

    Scenario outline will run all the steps same number of time depending on how many
    sets of data you have stored inside Examples. Examples are must for Scenario Outline.

HW:
Search for employee
1. 5 sets of data for searching by id
2. 5 sets of data for searching by name

use background and scenario outline
